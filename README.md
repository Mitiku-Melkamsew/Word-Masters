# Word Masters

**Word Masters** is an interactive word game where players must guess the **Word of the Day**. If you guess correctly, you win; otherwise, you lose. With each guess, the game provides feedback by indicating:

- **Correct Letters**: Letters in the correct position.
- **Close Letters**: Letters present in the word but in the wrong position.
- **Wrong Letters**: Letters not in the word at all.

This project is part of my learning journey through **Frontend Masters**. It serves as a hands-on practice to build real-world applications and strengthen my understanding of:

- Fetching data from an API (to get the word of the day).
- Posting data to an API (to submit guesses).
- Managing DOM interactions using event listeners.
- Working with JavaScript fundamentals and more.
